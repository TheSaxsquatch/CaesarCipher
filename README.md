### What is a Caesar Cipher?

A Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter of your message is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of
positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B by C, C by D, and so on. In this cipher, we are going to need a string value
as well as a number value to be stored as a shift key for encoding. The arithmetic for the cipher can start by transferring the leters into numbers 0 - 25. 

For this code, the following formulas will be assumed:

(Decryption Phase with shift n)


### Algorithm for Caesar Cipher: 
#### Input: 
* A String of lower case letters, called Text.
* An Integer between 0-25 denoting the required shift.

#### Procedure: 
* Traverse the given text one character at a time .
* For each character, transform the given character as per the rule, depending on whether weâ€™re encrypting or decrypting the text.
* Return the new string generated.
